<h1>Congratulations.</h1>
<p>We really liked meeting you and would like to learn more about you in an individual interview with a current ASES member.</p>
<BR>
<b>What to Expect During the Individual Interview</b>
<p>
We are conducting these interviews to learn more about who you are. We want to know what drives you and learn about your key strengths and witnesses.
</p>
<p>
Two members of the ASES officer team will be observing you and noting how you stand out within a group as well how you seem to mesh with the rest of your team. Based on these evaluations, we will invite a group of people back for individual interviews. You’ll be notified whether or not you’re moving on to the individual interviews by Thursday at midnight.
</p>
Attire will be <b>casual</b> for the group interview.<BR>
<BR>
You need not prepare anything in advance for the group interview, but <b>please bring your laptop</b>.<BR>
<BR>
We look forward to meeting you.<BR>
<BR>
<p>
<b>Regards,</b><BR>
Emily Xie and Tommy Fang<BR>
